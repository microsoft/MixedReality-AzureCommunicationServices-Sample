# Sample: Video Calling and Teams in a HoloLens 2 Application

## Introduction

This sample demonstrates how to use the Azure Communication Services within an immersive mixed reality application, running on HoloLens 2.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
2. Install [Windows 10.0+ SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/)
3. Install [Unity 2022 LTS](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) with Universal Windows Platform Build Support
4. Install [.Net 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
5. Install [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
6. Clone [repository](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-AzureCommunicationServices-Sample)
7. Access to a work/school Teams account with administrative privileges.

## Overview

[Azure Communication Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview)  (ACS) empower developers to seamlessly integrate voice, video, chat, telephony, and email communications into their applications. In this HoloLens 2 sample application, we focus on Teams interoperability, specifically joining Teams meetings. Hereâ€™s what our app demonstrates:

1. **Authenticated Teams Integration:** Connect to ACS as an authenticated Teams user using your work/ school credentials.
2. **Microsoft Graph Integration:** Retrieve coworker information and upcoming meetings.
3. **Teams Meeting Participation:** Join Teams meetings with video and audio.
4. **Live Captions:** Render live captions during Teams meetings.
5. **Incoming Calls:** Accept 1:1 Teams video and audio calls.
6. **XR Interactions with MRTK3:** Utilize the [Mixed Reality Toolkit 3](http://www.mixedrealitytoolkit.org) for seamless XR interfaces.

There are many more Azure Communication Services features not covered by this sample application. Please visit the Azure Communication Services [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/overview) for additional features and pricing.

## App Components

This immersive HoloLens 2 sample is made up of two parts:

* **Unity App**. A native application that runs on HoloLens 2 devices.
* **Web App**. An Azure Function application that returns an Azure Communication Services access tokens for an authenticated user using a Microsoft Entra ID.

The following Microsoft components are used by this sample:

* **[ACS Calling SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features)**. Unity app uses this to connect to ACS meetings and participate in video calls.
* **[ACS Identity SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/concepts/identity-model)**. The provided sample Azure Function App uses this to obtain ACS access tokens.  
* **[Azure Identity SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/overview/azure/identity-readme)**.  Also used by the provided sample Azure Function App.
* **[Azure Functions SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs?tabs=in-process)**. Used by the provided sample Azure Function App.
* **[Mixed Reality Toolkit 3](http://www.mixedrealitytoolkit.org)**. Used to create mixed reality user experiences in Unity.
* **[Web Account Manager (WAM) for UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/security/web-account-manager)**. Windows authentication broker to authenticate users on HoloLens.
* **[Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-overview)**. Authentication library used to authenticate users in the Unity editor.
